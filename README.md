# Password-Generator
password generator is the first simple project in my hobby of coding. in this rendition i have added an applicaiton, with a background, and 3 input texts usig tkinter. 
the first 2 boxes correspond with the "Generate Password" button, the last one is used for hte "generate passphrase" button. "exit" does not work at this time, it is
coded but unresponsive, and has been noted as a bug that will get fixed in the future.

the password generator will generate a number of passwords at a number of lengths using every known english character & special character.

passphrase generator will generate a list of words on a single line, the number of words indicated by what the user input, will be randomly selected from nltk, all english words in the english dictionary.

hope you enjoy and i appreciate feedback as i continue to learn!
